However, the algorithms implemented in this package can be applied to almost any supervised classification data set and supports:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategorical features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous features\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscrete endpoints (i.e., classification)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuous endpoints (i.e., regression)",

This creates\n   a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClone this copy to your local disk:\n\n\n  $ git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/scikit-rebate.git\n  $ cd scikit-rebate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a branch to hold your changes:\n\n\n  $ git checkout -b my-contribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure your local environment is setup correctly for development. Installation instructions are almost identical to \nthe user instructions\n except that scikit-rebate should \nnot\n be installed. If you have scikit-rebate installed on your computer, then make sure you are using a virtual environment that does not have scikit-rebate installed. Furthermore, you should make sure you have installed the \nnose\n package into your development environment so that you can test changes locally.\n\n\n  $ conda install nose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart making changes on your newly created branch, remembering to never work on the \nmaster\n branch! Work on this copy on your computer using Git to do the version control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce some changes are saved locally, you can use your tweaked version of scikit-rebate by navigating to the project's base directory and running scikit-rebate in a script. You can use an example script in our \nexamples directory\n to begin your testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo check your changes haven't broken any existing tests and to check new tests you've added pass run the following (note, you must have the \nnose\n package installed within your dev environment for this to work):\n\n\n  $ nosetests -s -v\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you're done editing and local testing, run:\n\n\n  $ git add modified_files\n  $ git commit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nto record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with:\n\n\n      $ git push -u origin my-contribution\n\n\n\nFinally, go to the web page of your fork of the scikit-rebate repo, and click 'Pull Request' (PR) to send your changes to the maintainers for review. Make sure that you send your PR to the \ndevelopment\n branch, as the \nmaster\n branch is reserved for the latest stable release.

If the dependency requires a complicated installation, then we most likely won't merge your changes because we want to keep scikit-rebate easy to install.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line to pip install the library to \n.travis_install.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a line to print the version of the library to \n.travis_install.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly add a line to print the version of the library to \n.travis_test.sh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating the documentation\n\n\nWe use \nmkdocs\n to manage our \ndocumentation\n. This allows us to write the docs in Markdown and compile them to HTML as needed. Below are a few useful commands to know when updating the documentation. Make sure that you are running them in the base repository directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmkdocs serve\n: Hosts of a local version of the documentation that you can access at the provided URL. The local version will update automatically as you save changes to the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmkdocs build --clean\n: Creates a fresh build of the documentation in HTML. Always run this before deploying the documentation to GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmkdocs gh-deploy\n: Deploys the documentation to GitHub. If you're deploying on your fork of scikit-rebate, the online documentation should be accessible at \nhttp://<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>.github.io/scikit-rebate/\n. Generally, you shouldn't need to run this command because you can view your changes with \nmkdocs serve\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter submitting your pull request\n\n\nAfter submitting your pull request, \nTravis-CI\n will automatically run unit tests on your changes and make sure that your updated code builds and runs on Python 2 and 3. We also use services that automatically check code quality and test coverage.\n\n\nCheck back shortly after submitting your pull request to make sure that your code passes these checks.
